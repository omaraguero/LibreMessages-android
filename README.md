# Libre messages
Libre Messages is an app for chatting with other people using Kotlin and Firebase. This is a small project that I will be working on. It uses:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging V1
- Firebase Datastore
- Glide for image loading
- Image Picker
- XML with Data Binding

This app can:
- Send messages
- Receive notifications
- Authenticate users
Feel free to use it in your projects! :)
